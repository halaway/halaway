### Hi there!


My name is **Daniel** and I'm a recent Computer Science Graduate with a minor in Math from **Hunter College**.

I recently worked **@ Cushman & Wakefield Inc.**, as part of the Technology and Data Solutions Team while supporting the Valuation & Advisory Dept.

Currently, I'm  working on a project with MySQL, Python, and Docker, and have released several C++ desktop and browser based projects, along with a Chrome extension, [Quick Fill](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quick-fill/pfbbpdklmganoljhiceopghgjdmnmidd?authuser=0&hl=en) to autofill and quickly sign up for a Workday account.

```
I'm always looking to collaborate so feel free to connect!
```
